## Instructions
To play, first answer the quick questions asked of you (font, anti-lag, etc.). Then, you'll have to click to set the direction of your ball and click again on the power bar to set your power. After clicking for your power, it will automatically shoot the ball. You can receive 2 or 3 points. Once you have reached 55 points and you took about only 2 shots to make it in each time, you can click randomly to end the trial (or wait until you miss 5 times), at which point the screen will either flash red or green depending on whether you made the trial or not. Some text will show up with more details...

Happy playing!
